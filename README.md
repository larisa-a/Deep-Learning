# Deep-Learning

In this assignment, you will use deep learning recurrent neural networks to model bitcoin closing prices. One model will use the FNG indicators to predict the closing price while the second model will use a window of closing prices to predict the nth closing price.

The FNG file resulted in an evaluation that appeared to be different from my inference. 

You can see in this REPO:

- Custom LSTM RNNS and evaluations for the models

Which model has a lower loss? it appears the first model had a lower loss. 

Which model tracks the actual values better over time? the Second Model

Which window size works best for the model? 10.20
